We will be discussing the RJR Nabisco case on April 25 and 27. Please review the case in advance with the following questions in mind to aid in preparing your one-page summaries and group presentations.

1. What was the value of RJR Nabisco under
     a) The pre-bid operating strategy?
     b) The Management Group's operating strategy?
     c) KKR's operating strategy?
     
     
     
     
     
     
2. What accounts for any difference in the value of the three operating plans?





3. Evaluate the Special Committee's use of an auction of RJR Nabisco.




4. Which bid should the Special Committee select, if any? What other actions should the Special Committee take?




For the Pre-bid Strategy, assume that Assumed Debt is paid down in a similar fashion as in the Management Group Strategy. 

Some of you may have noticed, but for those who haven't. The relevering formula changes when you add additional security-types such as preferred stock. To see this, let's start with the formulas we had before. From the formula for WACC (without taxes):

$$R_A=\frac{E}{V}R_E+\frac{D}{V}R_D+\frac{P}{V}R_P$$
